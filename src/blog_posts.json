Maybe I will mess around with my STM32F4 dev board some more, I started porting over my high school AES library code to it a while ago."

This is the third iteration of the website, and the second actual server, but I have had the same domain for a while (maybe I could eventually shell out some money for aaroncook.io or aaroncook.com and just route this domain to the fancier one). I eventually want this website to feel like it's complete, not just a single portfolio or a page of my art project. I think this blog adds some variety. Maybe I will try to incorporate some outside services, like a method of commenting or embedding of GitHub content etc. But for now there's still basic things this blog could probably use which I haven't thought of."

I think a page indexing that project and now my Zines, Comics, and Books final could be pretty neat. I'll have to rip that old HTML from the now dead Apache server, luckily it is on the same VPS so it's not deleted. I'm taking Intermediate Digital Drawing in Spring 2019, so I'll probably have some more web-based projects to upload."
