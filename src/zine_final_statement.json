    "My final project “[voluntary_necessity_]” is a commentary on the prevalence of computers in my life as a computer science major. It is a web page on my personal website (http://aarongc.com/zinefinal). My inspiration for the page came from a personal website of a friend of mine that told the story of a trip he took. I love the idea of creating web pages dedicated to one idea or event, rather than a stream of content like social media. Another source of inspiration for the content of the piece is the game “The Talos Principle” which grapples with machines and humanity.",
    "Originally, I was planning on the page being only pictures with text laid over them. But, that felt very chaotic and hard to follow, so I went with an approach that sequenced my images with text in between them rather than on top. This combined with the monospace Lucida Console font gives a clean feel to the page as a whole. The color (or lack thereof) was also an important decision. My website has a unifying dark gray tone for the background and ivory for the text, so making the images grayscale makes them feel like they belong there.",
    "For the content of the piece, I wanted to reassess the “Day in the life” comic project from earlier this year. The images go through the day sequentially, even if the text next to them doesn’t explicitly state it. I wanted this project to sound indifferent or “matter of fact” about my state of being with computers. I think this adds to an emotionless feeling I want to portray with this page."
